The multi-output discrete grey forecasting model with spatial effects
 
Introduction
 
 

To address the limitation of many conventional grey forecasting methods that prioritize temporal dynamics analysis while often overlooking the essential spatial characteristics, we developed a multi-output discrete grey model tailored for forecasting electricity consumption in China’s Yangtze River Delta, incorporating spatial effects.
